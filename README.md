# Predicting Car Prices
This project investigates the relationships existing between various car features such as make, model, body-type, and price. 
Furtheremore, we deploy a linear regression model to estimate car prices based off the set of features selected after careful data-wrangling.

# The Dataset
We utilize the car data-set hosted on the IBM Cloud objec. The dataset can be obtained at: 'https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DA0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Data%20files/automobileEDA.csv'
